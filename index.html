					Hey there, my name is Amijeet Thakur. I am a final year undergraduate
					student from the department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur.

				<h2>Skills</h2>
				<p class="skills-des">
					I have been coding since my first semester at college. Ever since I
					started coding I fell in love with it. Since then, I have always
					engaged in some or the other form of hobbies which involve
					programming. I am always interested to make small interesting
					projects, websites, engage in competitive programming, read articles
					and books about the same. <br />
					My favorite programming language is C++. I love using python for
					making small games using the pygame module. I use Javascript for some
					cool web games or when needed in my websites. <br />

				<p class="experience-des">
					I have experience in the following fields in software engineering.
					<br />The first one being Reinforcement learning. I did a B.Tech
					project involving the same. The further details of which can be found
					<a href="https://github.com/amijeet/UAV-Networks">here</a><br />
					The second one was a web-development intern @Wirepaper studios. <br />
					Both of these experiences have taught me a lot! I am thankful for
					these opportunites I got.
